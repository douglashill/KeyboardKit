# KeyboardKit change log

- 4.3.1
    - Fixes overriding some API from some KeyboardKit classes not being possible because it was marked `public` instead of `open`.
    - Fixes the Jump to Selection command in `KeyboardTextView` not working for a plain insertion point (i.e. no selection, which is modelled as a selection with a length of zero).
- 4.3.0
    - Adds a Define command in `KeyboardTextView` to show `UIReferenceLibraryViewController` for the selected text.
- 4.2.0
    - Adds `KeyboardDatePicker` to let users use arrow keys to spatially change the selected date.
- 4.1.1
    - Fixes spatial arrow key selection in collections views not respecting `flipsHorizontallyInOppositeLayoutDirection`, `developmentLayoutDirection` and the way `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` and `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` can flip even when these properties specify that flipping should not occur. 
- 4.1.0
    - Adds calling the `UITabBarControllerDelegate` methods `shouldSelect` and `didSelect` when changing tab using a keyboard in `KeyboardTabBarController`.
    - Adds deleting rows using the delete key in the table view example in the demo app.
    - Improves demo app by making the large title visible initially in the sidebar without needing to manually scroll it a tiny little bit.
- 4.0.1
    - Improves table view deletion by selecting the new bottom row after deleting the bottom row.
    - Fixes the Delete command not being available in `KeyboardTableViewController` when the view controller was first responder rather than the table view.
    - Fixes the Back command being available incorrectly when the responder chain contains both a `KeyboardNavigationController` and another `UINavigationController` that is not a `KeyboardNavigationController`. Code style has been improved in other places to avoid this sort of thing happening again.
    - Fixes `KeyboardSplitViewController` disabling collapsing into the `compact` column.
- 4.0.0
    - Xcode 12.2 is now required.
    - Add support for Mac Catalyst in the demo app (optimised for Mac). 
    - Fixes the UIKit focus system interfering with selection on Mac Catalyst. 
- 3.0.2
    - Works around a UIKit issue where responders in the primary column of a `UISplitViewController` could unexpectedly provide key commands when the first responder is in the secondary column.  
- 3.0.0 / 3.0.1
    - Xcode 12 is now required.
    - Increases the deployment target from iOS 11 to iOS 12.
    - The demo app now requires iOS 14.
    - Adds `KeyboardSplitViewController` to help moving first responder status between columns in a split view. 
    - Adds warning logging when trying to set the `primaryAction` or `menu` on a `KeyboardBarButton` since those can’t be activated with a keyboard.
    - Adds `KeyboardCollectionViewDelegate` and `KeyboardTableViewDelegate` to be notified of selection changes using arrow keys and to disallow clearing selection with escape.
    - Adds an overhaul of the demo app to use a sidebar (or navigation stack) as the root view. The tab bar example has been moved to a modal.
    - Adds more sophisticated first responder management in the demo app. 
    - Adds an example showing a list with `UICollectionView`.
    - Adds an example showing `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` with nested groups.
    - Adds an example showing a triple column split view (available as a modal).
- 2.1.0
    - Resolves project settings warnings with Xcode 12.
    - Adds support for selection wrapping in any `UICollectionViewLayout`. 
    - Adds selecting the last item initially with `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` when pressing the up arrow with vertical scrolling or the trailing arrow with a horizontal scrolling.
    - Fixes selection in collection views not working as expected when there are supplementary views, decoration views, cells with an alpha of zero, or items for which the delegate returns false to `collectionView(_:shouldHighlightItemAt:)`. This issue affected  `UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration`.
    - Fixes selection in collection views sometimes shifting into an adjacent row or column when there is no padding between items.
    - Fixes the back command not working with nested `UINavigationControllers`s.
- 2.0.1
    - Adds support for Swift Packager Manager. 
- 2.0.0
    - Xcode 11.4 is now required.
    - KeyboardKit scroll views will no longer send their delegate `scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation(_:)` after keyboard-driven animations end. Instead, the scroll view’s delegate can conform to `KeyboardScrollingDelegate` to receive callbacks when keyboard-driven scrolling animations start or finish.
- 1.2.1
    - Changes Page Up and Page Down to semantic directions so they will scroll horizontally in a scroll view that can only scroll horizontally.
    - Fixes scroll views with `isPagingEnabled` set ending up off page boundaries if starting keyboard scrolling while the scrolling view was in-between pages while decelerating from touch scrolling.
    - Fixes keyboard scrolling resulting in an incorrect scroll position when content size is smaller than the bounds (seen as unwanted scrolling in the non-scrolling direction).
