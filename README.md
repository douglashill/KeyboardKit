# KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit makes it easy to add hardware keyboard control to iOS and Mac Catalyst apps.

Keyboard control is a standard expectation of Mac apps. It’s important on iOS too because a hardware keyboard improves speed and ergonomics, which makes an iPad an even more powerful productivity machine.

Apps created with AppKit tend to have better support for keyboard control compared to UIKit-based apps. I believe the principal reason for this is that most AppKit components respond to key input out of the box, while most UIKit components do not. KeyboardKit aims to narrow this gap by providing subclasses of UIKit components that respond to key commands.

**39 localisations**: KeyboardKit’s key command titles (for the discoverability panel on iPad or the menu bar on Mac) are localised into the main languages supported by iOS and macOS. The translations are based on localisation glossaries provided by Apple, and they were refined by referencing text used in similar contexts in Apple’s software. Full list of localisations: Arabic, Catalan, Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (Australia), English (United Kingdom), English (United States), Finnish, French (Canada), French (France), German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish (Latin America), Spanish (Spain), Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.

- No use of private API
- No swizzling
- App Store approved

## Status

The public API is currently kept minimal. Exposing more API without first understanding use-cases would increase the chances of having to make breaking API changes. If there is something you’d like to be able to customise in KeyboardKit, please [open an issue](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/issues) to discuss.

## Requirements

KeyboardKit supports from iOS 11.0 onwards. The latest Xcode 11.x is required.

KeyboardKit is written in Swift with a very small amount of Objective-C.

Both Swift and Objective-C apps are supported. Since KeyboardKit uses Swift, it’s not possible subclass KeyboardKit classes from Objective-C. However all other features of KeyboardKit are available to Objective-C apps.

## Installation

### Recommended

1. Clone this repository.
2. Drag `KeyboardKit.xcodeproj` into your Xcode project.
3. Add the KeyboardKit target as a dependency of your target.
4. Add `KeyboardKit.framework` as an embedded framework.

### Swift Package Manager

Add KeyboadKit to an existing Xcode project as a package dependency:

1. From the File menu, select Swift Packages › Add Package Dependency…
2. Enter "https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit" into the package repository URL text field

### CocoaPods

1. Add the following to your `Podfile`:
    
    ```ruby
    pod 'Keyboard-Kit'
    ```
    
2. Run the following command:
    
    ```
    pod install
    ```

CocoaPods may not be as well tested as the recommended steps above. Please [open a pull request](https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit/pulls) if you notice any problems.

## Usage

Import the framework:

```swift
import KeyboardKit
```

Instead of creating or subclassing a UIKit class directly, use the subclasses from KeyboardKit instead. All KeyboardKit subclasses are named by changing `UI` to `Keyboard`. For example replace

```swift
class SettingsViewController: UITableViewController {
    ...
}
```

with

```swift
class SettingsViewController: KeyboardTableViewController {
    ...
}
```

Or create KeyboardKit subclasses directly:

```swift
let tabBarController = KeyboardTabBarController()
tabBarController.viewControllers = [
    KeyboardNavigationController(rootViewController: SettingsViewController()),
]
```

In order to receive key commands, an object must be on the [responder chain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/touches_presses_and_gestures/using_responders_and_the_responder_chain_to_handle_events).

You can see more in the KeyboardKitDemo app.

## Credits

KeyboardKit is a project from [Douglas Hill](https://douglashill.co/). Some concepts were originally developed for [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/) and reimplemented in Swift for KeyboardKit. I use KeyboardKit in my [reading app](https://douglashill.co/reading-app/).
