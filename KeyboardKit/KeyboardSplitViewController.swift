/// A split view controller that supports navigating between columns using tab or arrows keys on a hardware keyboard.
///
/// This class does not read or set the first responder itself, because it would not know which descendant
/// within a column should be first responder. Instead instances of this class have a `focusedColumn` property.
/// This is simply tracking the state and does nothing on its own. To actually update the first responder the
/// `delegate` of the split view controller should conform to `KeyboardSplitViewControllerDelegate`. In the
/// delegate’s implementation of `didChangeFocusedColumn` it should update the first responder based on the
/// split view controller’s `focusedColumn`.
///
/// To read more about how to set up this class, please see the documentation in `KeyboardSplitViewController.md`.
///
/// This subclass only supports iOS 14 split view controllers that are initialised with a `style` and have their
/// view controllers set as columns. Using the `.unspecified` style is not supported.
///
/// This class requires certain delegate callbacks from the split view. Therefore an intermediate delegate
/// is added. This is mostly transparent. You can set the delegate and receive callbacks as normal, but if
/// you read the value of the delegate property it will not be the same as the object you set.

             (and probably in other cases too) this willChangeTo callback is too soon so the primary view is not
             in the hierarchy yet. This is smoothed over in the demo app by FirstResponderViewController
             updating the first responder whenever it appears or disappears but should work without that.

             We don’t want to use the completion of the transitionCoordinator because that would run after the
             animation, so would feel slow. Keyboard focus should move immediately in transitions.

             This issue does not occur when using arrow keys because we first set the final focusedColumn then
             change the display mode. The callback in the middle of this will be ignored because we already
             have the correct focusedColumn. But then the actual delegate callback happens last, after the view
             has been added so it’s fine.

             We are relying on UIKit adding the views for the incoming column synchronously, but if it didn’t
             do this the same issue would likely trigger when calling show/hide so would be noticed quickly.

 Known issue with UISplitViewController

 You can see this problem in a triple column split view by focusing the primary on an
 iPad in portrait or major split view and then pressing shift-tab three times quickly.

 If you tell UISVC to show(.supplementary) while it is transitioning from twoOverSecondary to
 secondaryOnly, it will initially say that it will transition to twoOverSecondary. However shortly
 after this, a deferred callback comes in saying it will transition to oneOverSecondary. This sort
 of makes sense: the expected end state for showing the supplementary from secondaryOnly would be
 oneOverSecondary but since it started at twoOverSecondary maybe it thinks it can take a shortcut
 to show the supplementary and then decides actually it can’t for some reason.

 The problem is that if you call show(.primary) in this window between the twoOverSecondary
 callback and the deferred oneOverSecondary callback, the UISVC does nothing. Presumably it
 thinks it’s already in or heading to twoOverSecondary and therefore the primary is or will
 be visible, so there’s nothing to do.
